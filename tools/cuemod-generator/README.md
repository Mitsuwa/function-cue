# Generate git repo roots cue.mod

Generates function-cue's `cue.mod` using golang 1.20.  This is needed because the providers are built with 1.20 and cue cannot `cue get go` the providers that are built on older golang versions

### Go Generate

`go generate ./...`

### Building

`docker build -t function-cue-cuemod:latest .`

### Running the docker container

`docker run -it -v $(git rev-parse --show-toplevel):/app/out function-cue-cuemod:latest`

### Note

the go.mod within the gitroot is **not** the go.mod generated by this cue.mod, this is because these providers are not needed for function-cue, only the cue schemas

if the go.mod was included, a `go mod tidy` would remove them because they are not used in function-cue golang code
