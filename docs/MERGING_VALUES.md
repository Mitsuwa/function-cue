# Merging Values

TODO

Values generated by `cue export` can optionally overwrite existing keys based on `export.overwrite` field in the `CUEInput` template

### Example

```yaml
apiVersion: apiextensions.crossplane.io/v1
kind: Composition
metadata:
  name: test-cue
spec:
  compositeTypeRef:
    apiVersion: database.example.com/v1alpha1
    kind: NoSQL
  mode: Pipeline
  pipeline:
  - step: run-cue-function
    functionRef:
      name: function-cue
    input:
      apiVersion: template.fn.crossplane.io/v1beta1
      kind: CUEInput
      metadata:
        name: basic
      export:
        overwrite: true
        value: |
          ...
```

`CUE` does not allow overwriting fields, for this reason the default is `overwrite: false`

### overwrite:true implementation

#### `XR`

Fields are set on the XR directly, overwriting existing fields

#### `PatchResources` DesiredComposed

Fields are set on the existing `CUEInput.Resources`, overwriting existing fields.  The existing resource is selected based on the kind+name

#### `PatchDesired` DesiredComposed

Fields are set on the existing resource, overwriting existing fields.  The existing resource is selected based on the kind+name

### overwrite:false implementation

If the field to be set already exists then function-cue will error

TODO

This is achieved by converting the existing Composition to a cue data structure and then attempting to merge them together
This will allow `cue export` to fail appropriately on existing fields
